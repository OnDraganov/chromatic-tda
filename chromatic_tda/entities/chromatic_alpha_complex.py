        """Generate a simplicial complex and sub-complex pair based on the parameters given.
        The parameter complex restricts the complex, the parameter sub_complex defines the sub-complex,
        and the parameter relative erases simplices from the complex to represent a relative simplicial complex.

        Each parameter can be given as a list of lists of labels. Each simplex is kept (for sub_complex and complex)
        or erased (for relative) iff the set of labels of its vertices is contained in one of the lists of labels.
        For example sub_complex=[['blue', 'red'], ['blue', 'green']] chooses those simplices whose vertices are labeled
        either 'blue' and 'red' or 'blue' and 'green', but NOT 'red' and 'green'; also NOT all three colors,
        'blue','red','green'. The single-color simplices, e.g. all 'blue', ARE chosen.

        If the labels are single-digit integers, the parameters can also be given as lists of words separated by commas.
        For example `sub-complex = 01,02` will return complex with the sub-complex being all simplices with
        colors 0, 1, 01 or 02 -- in particular, no simplices with colors 12 or 012.

        Finally, the parameter can also be one of the following words:
            'all' ... allow all simplices
            'mono-chromatic' ... allow simplices containing only one label (='0,1,2' if labels are 0,1,2)
            'bi-chromatic' ... allow simplices containing at most two labels (='01,02,12' if labels are 0,1,2)
            'tri-chromatic' ... allow simplices containing at most three labels (='012'='all' if labels are 0,1,2)
            Can also be written as 'one-chromatic' or '1-chromatic' etc... The dash is optional.

        Keyword arguments:
        allow_unused_labels ... By default (False), an error is raised if the sub_complex/complex/relative parameters
                                contain a label that is not used. To suppress this behavior, set this parameter to True.
                                In that case the unused labels make no difference on the result.
