# chromatic_tda

`chromatic_tda` is a package for computing six-packs of persistent diagrams of colored point clouds. Currently point clouds in R^2 with 2 or 3 colors are supported (see Future).

# Installation

## Install with `pip`

The package is uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/chromatic-tda/), so it can be installed with `pip`.

Run `pip install chromatic_tda`.

## Install from github project

The project uses `poetry` for Python dependecy management, which allows you to easily install all you need to run the package:

- Clone the repository
- Install `poetry`
- Go to the repository folder in terminal
- Run `poetry shell`
- Run `poetry install`
- [optional] Run `pytest` to check that the code runs

# How to use

Check the jupyter notebook file `manual` to see how to use the code.

# Warning

In the current version there is a bug due to floating point arithmetics: certain point-clouds show infinite class in cokernel, when there should not be any. We are working on the solution—version 1.0.3 fixing the issue is expected to be released by 20th of August.

# Future

The code is under active developement. The future plans include:
- Adding support for points in R^3
- Making persistence computation faster with clearing.
- Add more details and examples about how to use the code.

# Resources

The code is based on research done at Institute of Science and Technology by Ranita Biswas, Sebastiano Cultrera di Montesano, Ondřej Draganov, Herbert Edelsbrunner and Morteza Saghafian. A draft write up can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03128). An updated version is currently being written.

A presentation about the main concepts used in this package can be viewed on YouTube: [AATRN Online Seminar: TDA for Chromatic Point Clouds](https://youtu.be/HIqiF00yKaw).
